# BrowserGP
The `runtime` folder of Browser GP.

## How?
After trial and error, I created a tool for myself to extract the `runtime` of any GP instance.
Using this tool, I zipped the `runtime` and `Examples` folders separately and extracted them.
[Try out the tool](https://gpblocks.org/run/gp.html?raw.githack.com/RixInGithub/BrowserGP/master/extractor.gpp)!

## How to mod?
Great question! Unfortunately, I don't know how to mod this yet... :/
Fortunately, it looks like the structure of Browser GP looks similiar to local GP.

## How to run in browser?
Browse around the source of Browser GP's HTML and download 'em, change a bit here and there, and you have a local GP Browser instance! Woah!

## Why?!
Also a pretty good question...

Nevertheless, I'm going to preserve BrowserGP until the deletion of my account.
